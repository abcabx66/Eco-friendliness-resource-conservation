          <p>Until now, I’ve tolerated everything even things I didn’t like because I believed that you love me and there’s no third person between us.But remember this clearly if you are ever unfaithful, disloyal, flirtatious, or show any kind of disrespectful behavior, I will never tolerate it. I will not compromise on this because love, trust, and respect are the foundations of a relationship, and this is my final boundary.I’m not asking for too much from you. I have never force you to do something all I want for you , to stay true to your own character.
You don’t even seem to know what you want, or what you’re saying to me.You’re literally telling me you’ll flirt with other girls, share thoughts with them, have romantic conversations and you don’t even realize how all of this is destroying our relationship day by day.My trust in you is fading, and it feels like I’m becoming emotionally numb… like I’m falling out of love with you , Hearing these things makes me question if you’re really the one I’m meant to be with.
Because it doesn’t feel like this is how a true partner should talk.I swear, babe the way I love you… if I ever let you go, I’ll do it with the same intensity.If you ever do something that causes me pain, or something that you shouldn’t do while being in a committed, loving, and intimate relationship with me, then it will be a betrayal both to me and to your own morals. Maybe you’ll forget these words someday, but I won’t. If I sense even the slightest bit of negative energy from you in our relationship, I will step back from you forever. You don't deserve any chance on this circumstance.

         <p>You are dangerously disgustingly close to becoming my hated person . But i still love you lot and i want to continue this relationship this bond commitment between us we are not satisfied but we are happy actually ig i think we should focus on our individual lifes we have to be serious now for our individual goals I don't want any distraction from you i want a healthy peaceful relationship , we are committed to each other as a partner this is a time which can grow our life differently so stop being immature, i hate your immature unnecessary talks which has no sense if you want to make intimate female friends and if you want to flirt with them or want romantic conversations an all so go to the hell don't be a part of my life , your "hauwa marka ajaira alaap" is a easiest distraction to me stop being idiot selfish toxic unloved ungrateful . Myb i can only say this to youhhhh nijer dimag e na chorate parle amr kichui korar nai mukher kotha ami change koray dileo fitraat nijer ta nijer e korte hobe but my fitraat is clear. Yeah thats all , This is my last and final thought..
